DO NOT change the XHTML files directly. Modify the XML files instead
which are in DocBook format.

In order to build the XHTML files from the DocBook files, type "make"
either in this directory (make will recursively travel through all
sub-directories looking for XML files which have changed), or in the
directory of the XML file you modified (make will then only rebuild
the files in that specific directory).

Note that you need xsltproc installed to process the XML files
(xsltproc comes with libxml).

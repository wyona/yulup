    <title>The &project; Editor</title>
    <para>
      The &project; editor strives to bridge the gap between the Web and the desktop. Traditional editors were either stand-alone desktop applications, or in-browser tools. Stand-alone applications obviously lead to an impedance-mismatch between the user's browsing and publishing activity on the Web and the editing of documents. In-browser editors on the other hand can avoid this gap, but lack the features of a stand-alone application like access to the desktop, offline editing, import/export filters, etc. Furthermore, they often perform poorly or have scalability issues.
    </para>
    <para>
      &project; tries to bring together the Web and the desktop, offering the full capabilities of a conventional desktop application, but avoiding the gap between the browsing and publishing workflow by being integrated seamlessly into the browser. This enables the user to stay in the same application, no matter if she is browsing, reading, editing or publishing.

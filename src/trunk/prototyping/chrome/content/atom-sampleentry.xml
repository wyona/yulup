      <a href="http://rollerweblogger.org/page/roller">Dave Johnson</a> gave an <a href="http://rollerweblogger.org/page/roller?entry=tri_xml_2006_presentation">excellent talk</a> on the Atom feed format and Atom Publishing Protocol.  Here's the abstract:
      <blockquote>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Beyond blogging: Atom format and protocol</span>. Like XML-RPC and SOAP before, feeds and publishing protocols were born in the         blogopshere and quickly moved beyond blogging. Nowadays, web service providers are using         RSS/Atom feeds and REST-based publishing protocols as lightweight alternatives to SOAP. And         developers are finding new ways to combine web services from different sites into new         applications, known as "mash-ups" in the lingo of Web 2.0. If you'd like to do the same,         then attend this talk to learn about the new IETF Atom feed format (RFC-4287) and the         soon-to-be-finalized Atom protocol, which together form a strong foundation for REST-based         web services development.

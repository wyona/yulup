For the web-install and auto-update to work correctly, you have to follow these guidelines:

  1. Place the update.rdf file in
     http://yulup.wyona.org/download/update.rdf.

  2. The webserver must deliver update.rdf using MIME-type "text/rdf".

  3. The XPI file must be placed in directory
     http://yulup.wyona.org/download.

  4. All XPI files must be delivered using MIME-type
     "application/x-xpinstall".
